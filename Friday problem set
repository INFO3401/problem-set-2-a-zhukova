Friday problem set

1. cd ~ = changes current directory to home directory

mkdir ./problem_set_1 = makes a directory called problem_set_1 in the current directory that you're in 

touch submission.txt = creates a blank text file named submission.txt

cd .. = changes directory to the parent of the current directory that you're in

pwd = prints working directory


2. cp config.txt / =  copies config.txt to root from home

cd / = changes working directory to root

mkdir preferences = makes a directory(folder) called preferences in the current (root) directory

cd /preferences = changes directory to preferences directory in root

cp ~/preferences/prefs.txt /preferences = copies prefs.txt from a matching directory called preferences in my home directory

head /preferences/prefs.txt
tail /preferences/prefs.txt
head ~/preferences/config.txt
tail ~/preferences/config.txt

Should compare the first and last 10 lines of these two files. 


3. Why do you think it is important to have the following shortcuts for navigating the file structure?

A. Root because it's the top-most level of the file structure from which you can navigate down the rest of the tree

B. Home because, again, it's at the top of the file structure after root, which allows you to navigate to any files below it.

C. Parent because you might need to navigate to the parent of a given directory to see where you are in the tree.


4. Assume all of the directories below are valid directories (e.g., they exist and we have access to them). What would the following print out? 

cd /usrs/INFO3401/../homework/./problem1
pwd

This would print out /problem1


5. You have accidentally moved a file (~/Documents/datafile.csv) to your current directory rather than copying it. What command did you use to do that? What command should you have used to do that? What command might you use to undo it? 

You would have used the mv command to move the file. To copy the file, you should have used the cp command. To undo it, you could just move the file back to its original location using the mv command.
